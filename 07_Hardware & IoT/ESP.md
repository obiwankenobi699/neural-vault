To learn and build your own ESP32 smartwatch with gesture control and terminal functionality, start by studying open-source projects like **[Bellafaire/ESP32-Smart-Watch](https://github.com/Bellafaire/ESP32-Smart-Watch)** and **ZSWatch**, which provide full hardware schematics, PCB designs, and firmware code. Use platforms like **Instructables**, **Hackster.io**, and **PCBWay** for step-by-step guides on integrating components like round OLEDs, IMUs (e.g., ADXL337), and battery management systems.

Master key skills:

- **Arduino or MicroPython** for programming the ESP32
    
- **TFT_eSPI library** for display control
    
- **NTP client setup** for Wi-Fi time syncing
    
- **IMU data processing** (using libraries like Adafruit_LSM6DS) for gesture detection
  
  Yes, several simulation tools support multi-purpose hardware development beyond just watches:

- **Wokwi** is a full-featured online simulator for ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico, and more, with support for sensors, displays, Wi-Fi, and MicroPython. It’s ideal for testing gesture-controlled smartwatch firmware or other IoT projects in a browser.
- **Tinkercad Circuits** (by Autodesk) offers drag-and-drop simulation for Arduino and basic electronics, great for beginners.
- **EasyEDA** combines circuit simulation with PCB design, allowing you to simulate, design, and order manufactured boards.
- **TINA** and **EveryCircuit** provide advanced analog/digital circuit simulation with interactive visualization.

These tools let you simulate, debug, and prototype a wide range of embedded systems without physical hardware.
