# 🌐 **1. The First Internet (ARPANET)**

The very first version of the internet was **ARPANET**, built in **1969** by the U.S. Department of Defense (ARPA).

### **Why ARPANET was created?**

- To allow **computers to communicate** with each other over long distances.
    
- To create a **decentralized network** that could survive a nuclear attack (no single point of failure).
    
- To enable **researchers** in universities and labs to share data instantly.
    

### **First ARPANET message (1969)**

The first message was sent between:

- **UCLA** → **Stanford Research Institute**,  
    and the message was supposed to be "LOGIN", but the system crashed after two letters: **"LO"**.

# 🏛️ **2. MIT’s Role in Early Internet**

MIT was one of the **earliest and most important participants** in building the internet.

### **What MIT contributed:**

- Helped design packet switching concepts.
    
- Created the early email systems (MIT played a key role in developing the first email program).
    
- Helped define early network protocols.
    
- Participated in ARPANET experiments.
    

### Key point:

MIT was not the “first internet,” but it was one of the **first major research hubs** connected to ARPANET and helped shape early networking technology.

# 🕸️ **3. Why They Made the World Wide Web (WWW)**

The **WWW was created by Tim Berners-Lee** in **1990** at **CERN (not MIT)**.

### ❓ Why did he create the Web?

Because scientists at CERN had **too much information scattered in different computers** and needed a simple way to:

- **Share documents**
    
- **Link research** easily
    
- **Access information from any machine**
    

Before WWW:

- Internet existed (email, FTP, Telnet),  
    but there was **no easy way to click links and open webpages**.
    

### WWW introduced:

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language)
    
- **URL** (Web addresses)
    
- **HTTP** (communication protocol)
    

This made the internet accessible to **everyone**, not just scientists.

- **Subdomain**: `www` is a traditional subdomain (short for "World Wide Web") used to identify web servers. For example, in `https://www.example.com`, `www` is a subdomain of `example.com`.
    
- **Not a Folder**: While URLs like `https://www.example.com/folder/page.html` have paths (`/folder/page.html`) that resemble file directories, `www` itself is not a folder—it's part of the domain structure.
    
- **Domain**: The main domain here is `example.com`. `www` simply points to the same website as the root domain, often configured via DNS to work alongside or redirect to `example.com`.
    

Modern websites often treat `www.example.com` and `example.com` as equivalent, but technically, `www` is a subdomain.
